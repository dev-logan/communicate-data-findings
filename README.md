## Dataset

Ford GoBike system data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. The rental start time and return time are recorded, and 'duration_sec' is calculated. There is information about 'start station' and 'end station' respectively. It also includes the bicycle ID and information about the user who used it. There is information on whether each user uses a service called 'bike share for all'.

## Summary of Findings

It was found that bicycles are mainly used on weekdays and during the daytime. Considering that the hours are around 8 am and 17:00 in the evening, it can be inferred that they are used for commuting. Overall, subscribers tended to ride their bikes for a shorter amount of time than non-subscribers. Users also cycled longer on weekends than on weekdays and made more trips back to their starting point on weekends. When multiple variables were taken into account, non-subscribers used their bikes more and longer on weekends than subscribers. Subscribers can use their bicycles for regular use, such as going to work on weekdays.


## Key Insights for Presentation

Bicycle rentals are mostly made around 8 am and 5 pm on weekdays, which are the commute times. In addition to commuting to work, non-subscribers use bicycles for entertainment on weekends more than subscribers.
